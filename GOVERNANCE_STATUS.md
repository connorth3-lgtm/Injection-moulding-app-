| Real NVDA + VoiceOver validation | **hold** |

## Interpretation

`pass` describes software-controlled automation only. `authorized` describes internal publication authorization only. `hold` on an external-validation row is a truthful blocked state awaiting genuine release-bound human/device/platform evidence; it is not a software-test failure. `advisory-only` means MouldMaster does not provide validated production-recipe or automatic machine-control authority.

The Book may therefore be publication-authorized while independent Book SME review remains on HOLD. Those states are intentionally different and must not be collapsed into a single 'validated' label.
